## [2026-05-07.220011] - 2026-05-07

### Summary

P3a Contract-Aligned Surface Cleanup delivered in full. Execution routing convergence, cancel_scope fix, knowledge_sync audit trail, dead path cleanup (-88 LOC), blueprint milestone compression + P4b split-out.

### Changed

- **Execution routing convergence**: authorized ActionProposal → deterministic route derive (`_derive_route_from_authorized_proposal`); Router.classify demoted to bare-text legacy fallback
- **cancel_scope fix**: cancel_flow inlined in derive path, fixing default-to-global-cleanup bug when artifacts list is empty
- **knowledge_sync audit trail**: `knowledge_sync_result` threaded through full archive pipeline (success / blocked / archive_target_conflict)
- **Dead code removal**: removed 6 unreferenced private functions + 1 orphan constant (-88 LOC)
- **Test coverage**: +17 routing convergence tests, +2 archive knowledge_sync tests, classify exclusion + checkpoint split coverage filled
- **Blueprint restructure**: P0–P3a compressed to one-line summaries; runtime weight reduction split out as P4b (runtime_surface_consolidation)

### Plan Packages
