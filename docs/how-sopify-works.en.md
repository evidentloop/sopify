# How Sopify Works

## Design Rationale: Harness Engineering

Sopify borrows harness engineering ideas, but does not use them as the repository's homepage identity. This section explains design rationale, not product positioning.

## Main Workflow

</div>

Workflow notes:

- Every Sopify turn enters through runtime gate first
- Only code tasks go through complexity routing
- The standard host loop follows handoff contracts instead of guessing from `Next:`

## Checkpoint Pause and Resume

Checkpoint rules:

- `answer_questions` collects missing facts before a formal plan is materialized
- `confirm_decision` resolves design branches before resuming the default runtime entry

```

Layer notes:

- `blueprint/` stores durable knowledge and stable contracts
- `plan/` stores active work packages, not long-lived blueprint state; the directory is tracked, but `_registry.yaml` remains locally ignored
- `history/` stores closed-out plans and is tracked
- `state/` is the local runtime data layer ignored by git

## Appendix: Plan Lifecycle

This appendix is maintainer-oriented; most users only need the main workflow.
