AI coding tools are fast. But when they jump to code before the facts are clear, speed turns into rework. Sopify is a development process protocol layer for AI coding: in managed workflows, the host asks before coding when requirements are incomplete or a decision still needs you.

Sopify stores plans and verification receipts in `.sopify/` as project files tracked by git. Only the local resume pointers stay out of git. In the same repo, explicitly ask to continue or use `~go` to resume managed work from those files on any supported host.

No new editor, no new CLI. Install into the host you already use — Codex, Claude, Qoder, or Copilot.

**Design principles:**

- **Stop when unsure** — score every requirement; ask before assuming
- **Resume from anywhere** — plans and verification receipts are tracked in `.sopify/`; open the repo on any host and pick up where you left off
- **Trace every decision** — plans, choices, and reviews persist in `.sopify/`

**What Sopify prevents:**

- **Premature coding** — AI starts changing code before missing facts or decisions are resolved
- **Lost context** — switching hosts, machines, or teammates forces the work to be re-explained
- **Forgotten decisions** — important tradeoffs disappear into chat history instead of becoming project artifacts

## See It In Action

</p>

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/evidentloop/sopify/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --target codex:en-US
```

Sopify requires Python 3.11 or newer; the installer checks before downloading. This command
installs Sopify only.

Optional: append `--with-evidentloop` to the same command to install EvidentLoop; see
[Installation](#installation).

After install, use `~go` to start a managed workflow. See [Installation](#installation) for other hosts, Windows, and how to review the installer before running it.

**Already in a Sopify-managed repo?** Explicitly ask to continue or use `~go` to resume the current plan. Ordinary questions and small fixes are handled directly without automatically entering the previous plan workflow.

## Why Sopify?

**When requirements are unclear, it stops to plan first.**
You say "add a caching layer." Sopify doesn't start coding — it plans first: analyze, design, split into tasks, then save to `.sopify/plan/`. Only after you confirm the plan does it write code. Every line changed traces back to a decision.

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/readme-visuals/sopify-scene-ask-en.jpg" width="720" alt="Plan first, code second — discuss, record, execute" />
</div>

**Your teammate picks up where you left off.**
You start a feature in Codex, finish the design, and implement two of four tasks. Next week your teammate opens the same repo in Claude, types `~go`. Sopify reads the checkpoint and continues from task 3 — no handoff doc, no re-explaining context.

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/readme-visuals/sopify-scene-cross-host-en.jpg" width="720" alt="Seamless cross-host handoff" />
</div>

**Every decision leaves a trace.**
A month later, someone asks why the cache key includes the user ID. The answer is in `.sopify/plan/` — the requirement that prompted the decision, the design that resolved it, the review that approved it.

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/readme-visuals/sopify-scene-decision-en.jpg" width="720" alt="Every decision traced — auditable and reviewable" />
</div>

## Product Form

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/sopify-product-form-release-en.svg" width="900" alt="Sopify Product Form — host, skills, project assets, local handoff, and explicit archive" />
</div>

The host LLM executes. Sopify supplies shared workflow rules and preserves plans, decisions, and verification evidence as project files in `.sopify/`. Local resume pointers remain on the machine.

Sopify does three things:

- **Shared workflow rules** — supported hosts load the same Sopify workflow rules, so switching hosts does not change the process and boundaries you already confirmed
- **Git-tracked project record** — plans, decisions, and verification evidence travel with the repository; local pointers do not
- **Explicit resume and closeout** — ask to continue or use `~go` before the host resumes; `~go finalize` archives the plan only after delivery evidence is ready

## Architecture Details

For readers who want the internal layering behind the product form, the technical structure is below.

## Installation

Review before running:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o sopify-install.sh https://github.com/evidentloop/sopify/releases/latest/download/install.sh
less sopify-install.sh          # review before running
bash sopify-install.sh --target codex:en-US
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
iwr https://github.com/evidentloop/sopify/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 -OutFile sopify-install.ps1
Get-Content sopify-install.ps1 | more
.\sopify-install.ps1 --target codex:en-US
```

Host support:

| Host | Tier | Target | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Codex | PROTOCOL_VERIFIED | `codex:en-US` / `codex:zh-CN` | Full capability continuation |
| Claude | PROTOCOL_VERIFIED | `claude:en-US` / `claude:zh-CN` | Full capability continuation |
| Qoder | PROTOCOL_VERIFIED | `qoder` | Validated on Qoder CLI |
| Copilot | BASELINE_SUPPORTED | `copilot:en-US` / `copilot:zh-CN` | Prompt-only; payload uplift planned |

Pass `--workspace <path>` to target another repo, `--language <lang>` to control output language.

[EvidentLoop](https://github.com/evidentloop/evidentloop) is an optional code-change audit
tool. It turns a local Git diff into an interactive report, ties audit findings to changed
lines, and lets users update the report through feedback. To install the current official
CLI and Skill with Sopify, or reuse healthy existing components, pass
`--with-evidentloop` explicitly:

```bash
bash sopify-install.sh --target codex:en-US --with-evidentloop
```

Healthy existing components are reused without automatic upgrades. The Copilot Skill is
project-scoped; Sopify does not commit or update it. See
[Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md#optional-evidentloop-companion) for
prerequisites, host-specific paths, and the local/cloud boundary.

For the full setup guide, see [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md). For a step-by-step demo, see [External Repo Quickstart](./examples/external-repo-quickstart/README.md).

## Command Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `~go` | Automatically route and run the full workflow (auto-resumes if active plan exists) |
| `~go plan` | Plan only |
| `~go finalize` | Close out the active plan |

Most users only need `~go` and `~go plan`; maintainer validation commands live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration

```bash
cp examples/sopify.config.yaml ./sopify.config.yaml
```

```yaml
brand: auto
language: en-US
